</p>

### 🎯 Purpose  
The goal of this project was to design and develop a multiplayer online game in a team of three people, as the main assignment for the **Online Game Design (OGD)** course.

The course is part of the Master’s Degree in **Computer Science** at the **University of Milan**, and offers a specialized path in **video game design and development**, active since 2014 and unique in Italy. It is known for its collaboration with the **Politecnico di Milano** and strong ties with the game industry.

**OGD**, taught entirely in English, focuses on the **design and technical development of online multiplayer games**, combining disciplines such as game design, programming, computer graphics, AI, UX, and storytelling. It emphasizes **team-based, project-oriented learning**, where students conceive, prototype, and present a complete multiplayer game, culminating in participation in the **New Game Designer** industry showcase.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Language: `C#`  
- Game Engine: `Unity`  
- Tools & Platforms:  
  - `FMOD` (for dynamic audio design)  
  - `GitHub` (used for version control and team collaboration, including issue tracking and project planning)

### 🎫 Project Description  
**Pomegranade: Limbo** is a cooperative online party game for 2–4 players set in a mystical forest. The core gameplay is structured around **two alternating phases**:

- **Activity Phase (Daylight)**: Players gather resources by engaging in short, cooperative activities directly in the game world—such as chopping wood, harvesting magical pomegranates, and repairing defensive structures. These tasks require coordination, as some actions benefit from being performed simultaneously by multiple players.

- **Combat Phase (Night)**: As darkness falls, waves of shadowy creatures attack the central bonfire. Players must defend it using **pomegranate-based weapons** crafted from the gathered resources. Shooting mechanics are seamlessly integrated with the environment—players aim, charge, and throw projectiles in real-time, with each shot contributing to the team’s survival.

The game also features a **dynamic day–night cycle**, randomized debuffs, and a communication system based on customizable **emoticons**, encouraging strategy and emotional expression without relying on voice chat.

For more details on the game design and especially the implementation of the working prototype, see the full Game Design Document (GDD) linked below.

## 🎮​ MegaMan Battle Network – Full Synchro 👨‍💻

<p align="center">

</p>

### 🎯 Purpose  
The goal of this project was to design and develop a virtual reality experience individually, as the main assignment for the **Virtual Reality** course.

The course is part of the Master’s Degree in **Computer Science** at the **University of Milan**, and focuses on the exploration and application of **VR and AR technologies** using modern tools and development environments.  
Students are required to conceive and implement an interactive prototype that applies core XR techniques to a meaningful, functional, and technically sound project.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Language: `C#`  
- Game Engine: `Unity`  
- Tools & Platforms:  
  - `XR Interaction Toolkit`  
  - `OpenXR`  
  - `Meta Quest 2 and Meta Quest 3` headsets
  - `GitHub` (for version control and development tracking)

### 🎫 Project Description  
**MegaMan Battle Network – Full Synchro** is a first-person VR reinterpretation of the classic MegaMan Battle Network battle system, developed as a solo project.  
The player takes the role of MegaMan himself, standing on a 3x3 grid of blue tiles, while enemies (virus types) spawn on a symmetrical red grid in front. Combat is fast-paced and arcade-style, blending the strategic layout of the original series with immersive aiming and shooting mechanics in VR.

Combat is handled using the **Mega Buster**, which is physically integrated into the player’s right arm in-game. With the left arm, players can reveal enemies' names and health by bringing the hand near the headset and pressing a specific input—mimicking an in-universe scanning gesture.

The game features:
- **Procedural enemy waves**, with three enemy types, each having six progressively harder variants.
- **Roguelite structure**: when defeated, the player restarts from scratch.
- **Reward system** after each wave group: players may receive **health refills** or temporary **power-ups**.
- A focus on **personal high-score chasing** and endurance-based progression.

The project emphasizes tight mechanic integration, immersive VR interaction, and procedural variability—paying tribute to the original GBA titles while adapting them into a modern, room-scale VR experience.
