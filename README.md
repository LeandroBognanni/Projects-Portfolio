  alt="Representative Image" width="350"/>
</p>

### 🎯 Purpose  
The goal of this project was to design and develop a multiplayer online game in a team of three people, as the main assignment for the **Online Game Design (OGD)** course.

The course is part of the Master’s Degree in **Computer Science** at the **University of Milan**, and offers a specialized path in **video game design and development**, active since 2014 and unique in Italy. It is known for its collaboration with the **Politecnico di Milano** and strong ties with the game industry.

**OGD**, taught entirely in English, focuses on the **design and technical development of online multiplayer games**, combining disciplines such as game design, programming, computer graphics, AI, UX, and storytelling. It emphasizes **team-based, project-oriented learning**, where students conceive, prototype, and present a complete multiplayer game, culminating in participation in the **New Game Designer** industry showcase.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Language: `C#`  
- Game Engine: `Unity`  
- Tools & Platforms:  
  - `FMOD` (for dynamic audio design)  
  - `GitHub` (used for version control and team collaboration, including issue tracking and project planning)

### 🎫 Project Description  
**Pomegranade: Limbo** is a cooperative online party game for 2–4 players set in a mystical forest. The core gameplay is structured around **two alternating phases**:

- **Activity Phase (Daylight)**: Players gather resources by engaging in short, cooperative activities directly in the game world—such as chopping wood, harvesting magical pomegranates, and repairing defensive structures. These tasks require coordination, as some actions benefit from being performed simultaneously by multiple players.

- **Combat Phase (Night)**: As darkness falls, waves of shadowy creatures attack the central bonfire. Players must defend it using **pomegranate-based weapons** crafted from the gathered resources. Shooting mechanics are seamlessly integrated with the environment—players aim, charge, and throw projectiles in real-time, with each shot contributing to the team’s survival.

The game also features a **dynamic day–night cycle**, randomized debuffs, and a communication system based on customizable **emoticons**, encouraging strategy and emotional expression without relying on voice chat.

For more details on the game design and especially the implementation of the working prototype, see the full Game Design Document (GDD) and the Game Technical Document (GTD) linked below.

## 🎮 Blindrun

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/LeandroBognanni/Projects-Portfolio/blob/main/Images/BlindRun-Logo.png" 
  alt="Representative Image" width="450"/>
</p>

### 🎯 Purpose  
This project is currently under development and was started as the main assignment for the **Sound in Interaction** course.

The course is part of the Master’s Degree in **Computer Science** at the **University of Milan**, and focuses on the design and application of **interactive sound techniques** in digital experiences.  
Topics include signal-based and physical-model sound synthesis, spatial audio (e.g., reverberation, binaural rendering), perceptual and cognitive aspects of audio, and toolchains such as **Pure Data**, **FMOD**, and audio pipelines in **Unity** and other engines.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Language: `C#`  
- Game Engine: `Unity`  
- Tools & Platforms:  
  - `FMOD Studio` (for real-time spatialized audio via 3D events)  
  - `Unity XR Toolkit`, `OpenXR`  
  - `Meta Quest 2` headset (standalone mode)  
  - `GitHub` (for solo development and version tracking)

### 🎫 Project Description  
**Blindrun** is an experimental VR game inspired by the classic game of blind man's bluff (*mosca cieca*), where the player must rely entirely on **sound** and **touch** to navigate and win.

Set in an indoor environment (currently a futuristic sci-fi factory), the player is **completely blind**—no visuals are provided beyond the immediate outline of their **hands**. These hands are used to explore the world by physically touching surfaces and objects.  
When an object is touched, a custom **shader effect** reveals only the exact contact area in partial transparency, simulating the sense of **tactile perception** in an otherwise invisible world.

The objective is to **locate and tag all NPCs** in the environment. NPCs generate distinct, spatialized sounds as they move, speak, or interact with the environment. Each NPC has a different behavior: some hide, some flee, and others move erratically. The player must listen carefully, **interpret spatial audio cues**, and physically move toward the sound source to touch and “eliminate” the NPC.

Movement is fully embodied: players must **simulate running** by moving their VR controllers up and down like real arms. Navigating effectively requires combining proprioception, haptic feedback through hand contact, and a **precise awareness of 3D sound positioning**.

The game is built around the use of **spatialized audio** as the primary gameplay mechanic. FMOD handles all sound logic, with plans to integrate **Resonance Audio** or **Meta’s spatial audio system** for realistic 3D sound propagation and occlusion effects.

The prototype currently features a fixed map and basic enemy AI, with plans for future procedural level generation, multiple NPC archetypes, and progressively complex sound environments.

### 🎯 Purpose  
The goal of this project was to design and develop a virtual reality experience individually, as the main assignment for the **Virtual Reality** course.

The course is part of the Master’s Degree in **Computer Science** at the **University of Milan**, and focuses on the exploration and application of **VR and AR technologies** using modern tools and development environments.  
Students are required to conceive and implement an interactive prototype that applies core XR techniques to a meaningful, functional, and technically sound project.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Language: `C#`  
- Game Engine: `Unity`  
- Tools & Platforms:  
  - `XR Interaction Toolkit`  
  - `OpenXR`  
  - `Meta Quest 2 and Meta Quest 3` headsets
  - `GitHub` (for version control and development tracking)

### 🎫 Project Description  
**MegaMan Battle Network – Full Synchro** is a first-person VR reinterpretation of the classic MegaMan Battle Network battle system, developed as a solo project.  
The player takes the role of MegaMan himself, standing on a 3x3 grid of blue tiles, while enemies (virus types) spawn on a symmetrical red grid in front. Combat is fast-paced and arcade-style, blending the strategic layout of the original series with immersive aiming and shooting mechanics in VR.

Combat is handled using the **Mega Buster**, which is physically integrated into the player’s right arm in-game. With the left arm, players can reveal enemies' names and health by bringing the hand near the headset and pressing a specific input—mimicking an in-universe scanning gesture.

The game features:
- **Procedural enemy waves**, with three enemy types, each having six progressively harder variants.
- **Roguelite structure**: when defeated, the player restarts from scratch.
- **Reward system** after each wave group: players may receive **health refills** or temporary **power-ups**.
- A focus on **personal high-score chasing** and endurance-based progression.

The project emphasizes tight mechanic integration, immersive VR interaction, and procedural variability—paying tribute to the original GBA titles while adapting them into a modern, room-scale VR experience.

## 👨‍💻​ WatchOut

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/LeandroBognanni/Projects-Portfolio/blob/main/Images/WatchOut-Logo.png" 
  alt="Representative Image" width="350"/>
</p>

### 🎯 Purpose  
This project was developed as the final assignment for the **Distributed and Pervasive Systems (DPS)** course within the Master’s Degree in **Computer Science** at the **University of Milan**.

The course explores the development of applications in distributed environments, with emphasis on **peer-to-peer coordination**, **concurrent communication**, and **context-aware computing** in pervasive systems. Students are introduced to **message-oriented middleware**, **RESTful interfaces**, and **gRPC communication**, focusing on both conceptual and implementation aspects.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Language: `Java`  
- Communication Middleware:  
  - `gRPC` (peer-to-peer coordination and election algorithms)  
  - `MQTT` (game start and messaging broker)  
  - `REST API` (server communication, health monitoring)  
- Tools & Platforms:  
  - `Mosquitto Broker`
  - `Advanced REST Client`  
  - `Kotlin` 

### 🎫 Project Description  
**WatchOut** is a distributed software system simulating a multiplayer smart-device environment. The goal was to design and implement a realistic, autonomous coordination protocol among smartwatch devices, which act as virtual participants in a hide-and-seek–style simulation.

Key Components:

- **Player Process (Smartwatch Simulation)**  
  Each instance autonomously:
  - Registers with a central **Administration Server**
  - Coordinates with other peers via `gRPC` to:
    - Elect a seeker (based on distance to the virtual home base)
    - Request and grant mutual access to the **home base**
  - Sends simulated **heart rate data** using a sliding-window average to the server via `REST`

- **Administration Server**  
  Central service responsible for:
  - Registering new smartwatch clients
  - Storing and exposing player health data
  - Providing REST endpoints for external monitoring and analysis

- **Administration Client**  
  CLI-based admin tool to:
  - Send game start signals via `MQTT`
  - Broadcast messages to players
  - Query individual and aggregated heart rate data via REST

System Mechanics:

- **Seeker Election**: Distributed algorithm that selects a seeker based on the distance to the base. Ties are resolved by ID.
- **Home Base Mutual Exclusion**: A coordination protocol ensures that only one player can access the base at a time, simulating critical section access.
- **Dynamic Participation**: New peers can register mid-simulation and integrate into the system flow.
- **Health Monitoring**: Simulated heartbeat data is continuously tracked and made available for monitoring and evaluation.

The system was developed individually and demonstrates the application of **distributed coordination**, **event-driven middleware**, and **sensor-like data integration** in a pervasive computing scenario.

  <img src="https://github.com/LeandroBognanni/Projects-Portfolio/blob/main/Images/DrunkStrider.png" 
  alt="Representative Image" width="300"/>
</p>

### 🎯 Purpose  
This project was developed as the assigned exercise for the **Artificial Intelligence for Video Games** course.

The course is part of the Master’s Degree in **Computer Science** at the **University of Milan**, and focuses on the design and implementation of AI systems within interactive virtual environments.  
Topics include AI architecture in game engines, decision-making models, movement and pathfinding, procedural content generation, and introductory techniques in **machine learning** and **genetic algorithms** applied to game development.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Language: `C#`  
- Game Engine: `Unity`  
- Tools & Platforms:  
  - `GitHub` (for version control)

### 🎫 Project Description  
**Drunk Stride** is a simple AI-based simulation developed in Unity. The objective is to create an autonomous agent that continuously moves across a platform **without ever walking in a straight line**.

The character (a “drunk” NPC) alternates left and right circular motions with **randomly selected radii** and **time intervals**, simulating unsteady, unpredictable movement. At every change, a new radius and rotation direction (left or right) are chosen, ensuring that the agent constantly adapts its path while maintaining a **fixed speed** of 1 m/s.

Key features:
- Circular motion around dynamically updated pivot points  
- Full compliance with movement constraints: the agent never stops or exits the platform regardless of shape or size  
- Modular architecture: components like rotation control, movement logic, and gaze direction are handled by separate scripts  
- Minimalist top-down scene for focused testing

The project was completed individually and aimed to demonstrate understanding of **behavioral scripting**, **randomized decision logic**, and Unity-based agent control systems.
For more information see the **Project Report** linked below.
